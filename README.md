Project title: Panspermia in the Sun's locale

# Project Description

Litho-panspermia is the idea that life can be transferred between stellar
and planetary systems on rocks that are either directly exchanged
between stars, or are captured by one star after being ejected from
another planetary system. In this project you will estimate how many
rocks can be exchanged/captured by Sun-like stars in the Milky Way, and
then estimate how many of these rocks may harbour biological material
that could survive the harsh environs of interstellar space. The project
requires some prior knowledge/experience of coding (Python, or a compiled
language such as C or Fortran).
